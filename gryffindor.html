            </h3>
            <p id="i1" class="text">Harry James Potter is the main protagonist of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series of fantasy novels.Harry James Potter (1980â€“present) is the only son of Lily and James Potter. He became famous at the age of one, when the Dark wizard Voldemort tried to kill him with a curse that rebounded and reduced Voldemort to a spirit-like existence, causing his first downfall. Both of Harry's parents died in the attack, and he grew up with his Muggle relatives, never knowing that he was a wizard. At his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he could do magic and agreed to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Gryffindor. During his school years, Voldemort tried to kill him several times, but Harry escaped. He eventually became a leading figure in the Second War against Voldemort and defeated him in the Battle of Hogwarts on May 2, 1998..</p>

            Hermione Granger
            </h3>
            <p id="i2" class="text"> Hermione is a Muggle-born witch. She has bushy brown hair and brown eyes, and had buck teeth until her fourth year. However much Ron and Harry tease her, they both depend on her intelligence for their continuing success in academics. She is the most sensible of the Trio and is usually the one to solve the mysteries they are faced with.

                It was clear before she had even started at Hogwarts that Hermione was ambitious and curious: before even stepping foot in the school, she had read and memorised all of her textbooks. When she met some of her classmates for the first time on the Hogwarts Express, Hermione demonstrated an impressive amount of knowledge of Hogwarts and magic for a Muggle-born.
